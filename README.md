# Risk-Assessment-Matrix
**Tools Used**: Excel | Risk Scoring Methodology | Risk Management Frameworks

**Overview:**
I developed a comprehensive Risk Register and Risk Assessment Matrix tailored for a banking institution to proactively manage operational, financial, regulatory, and strategic risks. The register identifies, assesses, and prioritizes risks while proposing both mitigating actions and contingency plans for each case.

# Key Features:
- Identified and documented 10 critical banking risks including IT failures, cyber threats, market volatility, loan defaults, and AML compliance.
- Incorporated risk attributes such as Likelihood, Impact, Severity, Risk Owner, and Category.
- Assigned quantitative risk scores using a scoring model (Likelihood x Impact).
- Integrated mitigation strategies and contingency planning to ensure preparedness.
- Created Risk Assessment Matrix using Impact Score and Likelihood Score. 

# Conclusion:
This structured approach ensures risks are continuously monitored, evaluated, and escalated when necessary â€” contributing to stronger governance, compliance, and operational resilience.
